### Introduction/Background


### Problem Definition

### Methods


### Potential Results
From our machine learning methods, we are expecting our algorithm to correctly assign a score to an image using a kernel. The score will be a numerical value that will determine how asymmetrical the blemish is, the border irregularity, and the color. Once these values have been assigned, they will then be added together in a weighted average. This score will then be compared to the scores of our training data and  determine whether or not this is an image of cancerous skin or not. Overall we expect to generate a way to classify skin with cancer using a numeral representation, and create an algorithm that can successfully categorize the image as either belonging to malignant or benign.
