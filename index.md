### Introduction/Background
Skin cancer is becoming exponentially prevalent in the United States. Due to the increasing risk of skin cancer, it is important to be able to diagnose malignant cancers before it reaches stages that are difficult to treat.
Often times, skin cancer can be diagnosed looking at the ABCâ€™s (Whited & Grichnik, 2019):  

* Asymmetry
* Border
* Color

We aim to use machine learning to evaluate images of potential skin cancer photos and identify which images demonstrate benign and malignant candidates.
### Problem Definition
How can we use machine learning methods to identify if skin cancer is present in an image?
### Methods


### Potential Results
From our machine learning methods, we are expecting our algorithm to correctly assign a score to an image using a kernel. The score will be a numerical value that will determine how asymmetrical the blemish is, the border irregularity, and the color. Once these values have been assigned, they will then be added together in a weighted average. This score will then be compared to the scores of our training data and  determine whether or not this is an image of cancerous skin or not. Overall we expect to generate a way to classify skin with cancer using a numeral representation, and create an algorithm that can successfully categorize the image as either belonging to malignant or benign.
